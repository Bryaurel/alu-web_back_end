Import wait_random from the previous python file that youâ€™ve written
and write an async routine called wait_n that takes in 2 int arguments

    spawns wait_random n times with the specified max_delay

    n (int): The number of times to call wait_random
    max_delay (int): The maximum delay value passed to wait_random
